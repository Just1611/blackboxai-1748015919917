# Unity 3D Realistic Racing Simulator

This project is a realistic 3D racing simulator built in Unity with advanced graphics using HDRP, realistic car physics, full support for PXN V9 GEN 2 wheel controllers, detailed environments, and a modular script architecture.

## Features

- Advanced graphics with HDRP, dynamic lighting, shadows, reflections, 4K textures, and day/night cycle.
- Realistic car physics including suspension, tire grip, aerodynamics, and tire wear.
- Full support for PXN V9 GEN 2 wheel with force feedback, pedals, and manual shifter.
- Two detailed racing circuits: urban and race track.
- Functional HUD with speed, RPM, gear indicator, and minimap.
- Single-player mode with car selection, main menu, and career progression.
- 3D audio for engine, collisions, tires, and environment.
- Modular scripts: InputManager, PhysicsManager, UIManager, AudioManager, GameManager.
- Clear documentation in code comments.
